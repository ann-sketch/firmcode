### Project Pitch
We are well honored to given the opportunity to participate in such a prestigious event and its first launch, providing developers a new experience in the ever-changing technological world.
Ayoba Store is the name of our micro-app project. 
Well, I guess you’re wondering why we would want to build this, let me explain. From research we noticed that the most successful fintech companies in Ghana, MTN, didn’t have its own sales platform over the internet for the merchandise. All devices and other products made by the company are sold on premise at quite distant locations.
To therefore enhance marketing, increase efficient sales, easy advertisement of products to customers, eliminate the cost of advertisement on third-party platforms, and reduce the cost incurred on selling on other third-party platforms, we provide you with the Ayoba Store.
With its inclusion to the Ayoba super app, we provide both customers and the fintech company greater benefits relating to above mentioned benefits and secure transactions with buying authentic MTN products.
Now to the features of the app. The app is designed to have a clean and easy to use interface for customers and a personal administrative page for the admin users, an incorporation of MTN MOMO for instant payment, and has a security message sent to customers to validate their purchase and verification of products purchased once delivered.
This concludes our pitch, and hope that our app for the hackathon is considered and we are selected among the 5 participants for the next stages. Thank you.
